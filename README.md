# Digital-StoryTelling-For-StackExchange

This application is a website that analyzes the StackOverflow data host interesting visualizations to answer the following questions.

<li>The distribution of skillsets across the globe. For example, where can we find majority of python programmers and where should a company look for java programmers? 
<li>Are programmers night owls or do they work during the day time? What time are they most active?
<li>Do the most active programmers use fake locations like “over there” , “earth” or “over the keyboard” instead of their actual locations?
<li>How many users are active contributors for more than one tags?
<li>Which geographical area has the most number of active users? 
<li>What are some of the popular languages/technologies/frameworks?
<li>What all skillsets go together? For example, do SQL and ORMs go hand in hand?

Apart from answering these questions, we would like to perform sentiment analysis of the comments and answers for questions posted by new users and find out if they are encouraged or discouraged from joining the community. 

These visualizations along with many more would be available on a website that will be integrated with the database.
